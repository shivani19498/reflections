When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I intend to share my work with public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes,I may not be working on my computer or I may not have made the changes myself.
In such situations,I will need to pull changes manually.
