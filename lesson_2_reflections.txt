What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialise a repository,a file .git gets added to that folder and
a repository is created with an initial commit.We need a repository to track
all the cheanges int hte form of commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?

staging area is basically that part of the repository which helps us to make 
commits.We add those files to the staging area in which we want to make some
logical changes.
